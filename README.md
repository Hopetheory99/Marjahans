# Marjahans WooCommerce Project

This repository contains the source code and configuration for **Marjahan's** online jewellery store. Development is guided by the rules in the `AGENTS` file and tasks in `marjahans_bootstrap.yaml`.

## Getting Started

1. Review `docs/project_plan.md` for an overview of milestones.
2. Install the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) and run:
   ```bash
   codex marjahans_bootstrap.yaml
   ```
   to scaffold the WordPress environment, custom theme, and plugins.
3. Follow the coding standards described in `AGENTS` and update documentation under `docs/` when new decisions are made.

This repository is intentionally lightweight; most directories will be generated by Codex during the bootstrap process.
